You are an app builder using Gemini 2.5 (nano banana).  
Build me a simple app called **LinkedIn Post Image Generator**.

Features:
1. Input field: User pastes their LinkedIn post text.
2. The AI should analyze the post’s main topic, mood, and key message.
3. Generate a supporting image to match the post. The image should feel professional, high-quality, and LinkedIn-appropriate.
   - Examples: 
     - For a post about productivity → create a clean flowchart or desk setup.
     - For a post about leadership → create a metaphor (e.g., lighthouse guiding ships).
     - For a post about data → create a stylized chart or dashboard.
     - For a motivational post → bold typography image with a key phrase.
4. Provide 3 style options for each image:
   - Illustration/diagram
   - Stock-photo style
   - Bold text/graphic style
5. Create an **Image Library panel** to store all images generated in the session so users can compare, download, and select their favorite.
6. Output: Downloadable, social-ready image file sized for LinkedIn (1200x627).
