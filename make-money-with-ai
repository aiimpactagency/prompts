PROMPT

You are an AI strategist, analyst, and dashboard designer.

Your task:
Analyze the uploaded document that lists 200+ ways to make money with AI and produce BOTH:
1. A **personalized AI income opportunity report** (3–7 ideas best suited to me)
2. An **interactive dashboard** built directly in ChatGPT Canvas or using Python visualizations.

---

## INPUT CONTEXT
Use what you know about me from chat history **OR** what I enter below.

[User Input Field — optional]
• Who I am / what I do  
• Skills and strengths  
• Available time or budget  
• Monetization goals (e.g. passive income, consulting, audience growth)  

---

## STEP 1: SCAN & MATCH
From the uploaded document:
- Identify the best-fit AI income opportunities for me.
- Evaluate each idea based on:
  - Alignment with my background and goals  
  - Skill match  
  - Startup cost & time to revenue  
  - Ease of execution  
  - Long-term scalability & recurring potential  

Select the **top 5–7 ideas** with the strongest alignment.

---

## STEP 2: SCORING FRAMEWORK
Assign the following metrics:

**Primary Score (0–100)** → Profitability Potential  
**Secondary Score (0–100)** → Ease & Speed to Launch  
**Tertiary Score (0–100)** → Scalability

Then calculate a **Composite Opportunity Index**:  
`Opportunity Index = (Profitability * 0.5) + (Ease * 0.3) + (Scalability * 0.2)`

Add supporting data:
- Startup Cost ($ / $$ / $$$)
- Time to First Revenue (weeks / months)
- Confidence (Low / Medium / High)
- Recommended AI Tools / Tech Stack
- Monetization Model
- Skill Level Required (Beginner / Intermediate / Expert)
- “Fit Reason” (short explanation why it matches me)

---

## STEP 3: DATASET STRUCTURE
Return data as both a table and a JSON array:

{
  "idea": "",
  "category": "",
  "profitability": "",
  "ease": "",
  "scalability": "",
  "opportunity_index": "",
  "startup_cost": "",
  "time_to_revenue": "",
  "confidence": "",
  "ai_tools": "",
  "monetization_model": "",
  "fit_reason": ""
}

---

## STEP 4: DASHBOARD GENERATION
Build a clean dashboard with these elements:

**Header:** “Top AI Income Paths for [User’s Name]”

**KPI Tiles:**
- Highest Profitability
- Highest Ease
- Highest Scalability
- Fastest Time to Revenue
- Median Startup Cost

**Charts:**
1. **Bar Chart:** Profitability vs Ease (Top 7 Ideas)
2. **Scatter Plot:** Opportunity Index vs Startup Cost (size = scalability)
3. **Radar Chart (optional):** Profitability, Ease, Scalability comparison
4. **Sortable Table:** all metrics with color-coded “Opportunity Index”

**Insights Panels:**
- **Strategic Summary:** 150–200 words explaining:
  - Which ideas have the fastest payback  
  - Which have the highest long-term upside  
  - Which are low-barrier entry options  
  - Key trade-offs or risks
- **“If I were you” Section:** 3 sentences giving action priorities
- **Quick-Win Plan:** one line per idea (“Next step this week”)

---

## STEP 5: INTERACTIVITY (SIMULATION MODE)
Allow pseudo-interactivity:
- Ask: “Would you like to re-rank based on [Profit vs Ease / Short-Term vs Long-Term]?”
- If user updates constraints (e.g. “budget = $500” or “I want recurring income”), re-score dynamically.

---

## STEP 6: OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Return:
1. JSON dataset (for charts)
2. Rendered dashboard (charts + KPI tiles + table)
3. Strategic Insights summary
4. Quick-Win recommendations
