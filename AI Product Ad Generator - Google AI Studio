You are an app builder using Gemini 2.5 (nano banana).  
Build me a simple app called **AI Product Ad Generator**.

Features:
1. Upload a product image (PNG or JPG).
2. Optionally add ad copy (e.g., “Summer Sale – 50% Off”).  
   - The AI should style the text to match the chosen scene.
3. Present a list of ad formats to choose from (user clicks one). Include:
   - Times Square Billboard
   - Bus Stop Ad
   - Glossy Magazine Spread
   - Subway Car Poster
   - Vintage Newspaper Ad
   - Social Media Story
   - Airport Luggage Carousel
   - Coffee Shop Table Stand
   - Movie Theater Screen
   - Stadium Jumbotron
   - Instagram / Facebook Feed Post
   - TikTok Vertical Ad
   - E-Commerce Product Page Mockup
   - Email Banner Ad
   - YouTube Pre-Roll Ad Thumbnail
   - In-App Mobile Banner
   - Highway Billboard
   - Retail Shelf Display (end-cap or in-store signage)
4. After a user selects a format, generate a realistic composite of the product in that ad setting, with the ad copy integrated.
5. Provide an “Additional Instructions” field where the user can describe extra details (e.g., add a countdown timer, include a clock, adjust placement, apply color accents).
6. Create an **Image Library panel** where all generated ads stay saved for the session.  
   - Users can view, download, or compare multiple versions side by side.
7. Output: A clean, shareable preview of the final ad in the chosen format.
