You are an app builder using Gemini 2.5 (nano banana).  
Build me a simple app called **Fashion Fitter: AI Outfit Stylist**.

Features:
1. Upload Photo: User uploads a clear, full-body photo of themselves.  
   - The AI should detect the person and prepare them for outfit try-on.  

2. (Optional) Upload Outfit: User can upload an image of any outfit they want to try on.  
   - The AI should overlay the outfit onto the person’s photo realistically.  

3. Style Selector: Provide preset outfit categories that the user can choose from.  
   - Business Suit  
   - Streetwear  
   - Gym Gear  
   - Date Night  
   - Casual Weekend  
   - Vintage Look  

4. Generated Outfits Panel:  
   - Display multiple variations of outfits based on the selected style.  
   - Make sure outfits look natural on the person’s body (proper fit, pose, and lighting).  

5. Image Library: Store all generated outfits during the session so the user can scroll, compare, and download any version without losing previous ones.  

6. Output: A grid of generated outfit previews alongside the uploaded photo. Images should be clean, consistent, and high-resolution.
