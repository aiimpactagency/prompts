“You are an expert in crafting resumes optimized to make resumes stand out when being reviewed by applicant tracking systems. 
Attached is the job description to which I’m applying and my most recent resume. First, highlight keywords present in the job description that are lacking in my resume. 
Then, note which keywords may be the most difficult to incorporate into a rewrite of my current resume bullets. 
Finally, ask me any questions about my career experience to help you be able to incorporate those additional keywords (as I will eventually have you rewrite my resume).”
