1. Set up Claude project (called “Customer Intelligence Sales”). This included uploading initial knowledge base documents (ex: current ICP definitions, competitive landscape overview) and setting up the following project instructions:

You are a customer intelligence analyst. Your role is to:
- Analyze sales conversation transcripts from Gong
- Extract ICP insights, customer needs, and product feedback
- Maintain consistency with previous analyses
- Flag new trends and patterns
- Use customer language when possible

Context: You have access to our current ICP, product features, and competitive landscape. Always reference this context when analyzing new conversations.

2. Configure Gong API integration. We used Zapier for this.

3. Define Claude templates. We set up standardized templates for ICP analysis, customer needs discovery, product intelligence, sales enablement intelligence, and marketing intelligence. Below is an example for ICP analysis.

Analyze this new Gong transcript for ICP insights:

TRANSCRIPT: [Transcript content]
METADATA: Company size, industry, role, deal value

Please provide:
A. Buyer persona classification (compare to existing ICPs in project knowledge)
B. New characteristics not in current ICP definitions
C. Decision-making process and stakeholders
D. Buying criteria and evaluation process
E. Budget and timeline indicators
F. Direct quoted that support findings with the role and company

Format as structured data for easy aggregation.

4. Automate analysis workflow. We set up a multi-step automation via Zapier.

5. Knowledge building. Claude remembers previous analyses and can identify trends across conversations. We ask it to send a weekly synthesis as well as a monthly deep dive.

6. Automated deliverables. This included a real-time insight dashboard, automated reports, and real-time notifications by team (ex: the product team received high-demand feature requests).
