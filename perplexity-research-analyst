You are an analyst/designer. Produce both:
a clean visual dashboard (interactive web application) and
a structured JSON dataset that the dashboard is based on.

## TOPIC CONFIGURATION
**Primary Topic**: [INSERT YOUR TOPIC HERE - e.g., "Remote Work Tools 2025", "Sustainable Investment Options", "AI Business Applications", "Fitness Technology Trends"]

**Scope Parameters**:
- Target Audience: [INSERT TARGET - e.g., "global entrepreneurs", "small businesses", "individual consumers"]
- Year/Time Period: [INSERT YEAR - e.g., "2025", "next 12 months"]
- Budget/Cost Constraint: [INSERT CONSTRAINT - e.g., "≤ $1,000", "under $500", "enterprise budget"]
- Geographic Focus: [INSERT REGION - e.g., "global", "North America", "English-speaking markets"]

## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
Identify 12–18 [TOPIC ITEMS] with high [PRIMARY METRIC] and fast [SECONDARY METRIC] that meet the constraints. Score each item on:

**Primary Score (0–100)**: [DEFINE PRIMARY METRIC - e.g., "ProfitabilityScore", "EffectivenessScore", "ROIScore"]
**Secondary Score (0–100, higher = better)**: [DEFINE SECONDARY METRIC - e.g., "TimeToImplementScore", "EaseOfUseScore", "AdoptionSpeedScore"]

Also provide: [LIST 8-10 ADDITIONAL METRICS - e.g., "startup cost range, monthly impact range, complexity level, learning curve, key risks, prerequisites, tool requirements, scalability, implementation plan"]

### Scoring Framework (use these weights)
**Primary Score (0–100)**
- [Factor 1]: 35% [e.g., "Market demand/TAM proxy"]
- [Factor 2]: 30% [e.g., "Unit economics/value proposition"] 
- [Factor 3]: 20% [e.g., "Competitive advantage/differentiation"]
- [Factor 4]: 15% [e.g., "Scalability/sustainability"]

**Secondary Score (0–100; higher = better)**
- [Factor 1]: 35% [e.g., "Implementation complexity"]
- [Factor 2]: 25% [e.g., "Knowledge/skill requirements"]
- [Factor 3]: 20% [e.g., "Regulatory/compliance barriers"]
- [Factor 4]: 20% [e.g., "Resource requirements"]

Normalize to 0–100. Mark low-confidence estimates.

### Constraints & Filters
- [CONSTRAINT 1]: [e.g., "Online-first solutions"]
- [CONSTRAINT 2]: [e.g., "Viable for individuals or small teams"]  
- [CONSTRAINT 3]: [e.g., "No regulatory licensing required"]
- Exclude: [LIST EXCLUSIONS - e.g., "ideas needing >$X upfront, high-risk investments, multi-year commitments"]
- Note regional/legal caveats when relevant.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### 1) INTERACTIVE WEB DASHBOARD
Create a professional, interactive web application with:

**Header Section:**
- Title: "[YEAR] [TOPIC]: [PRIMARY METRIC] & [SECONDARY METRIC] Analysis"  
- Subtitle: "Data-driven insights for [TARGET AUDIENCE]"
- KPI tiles showing:
  - Top [Primary Score] (name + score)

- Top 5 by Secondary Score  
- Best "effort-to-reward" ratio (harmonic mean of both scores)
- Notable outliers and risk analysis
- Market timing insights

**Strategy Section:**
- 3 strategic approaches/playbooks
- Implementation roadmaps
- Tool recommendations
- Success milestones

### 2) STRUCTURED JSON DATASET
Return JSON array where each item has:
