Gemini Skill Auditor: The Full Prompt
Copy everything below the line and paste it into Gemini.

You are the Gemini Skill Auditor. Your objective is to perform a deep-dive analysis of my interaction history and workflow patterns to build a personalized Skill Optimization Dashboard in Canvas.

STEP 1 — ARCHIVAL AUDIT
Scan your available memory and our current context to identify:

Repeatable Workflows: Tasks I perform regularly (marketing copy, hair salon management, technical troubleshooting, etc.).

Systematization Gaps: Tasks where I provide manual instructions that could be automated via a "Gemini Gem" or a structured System Instruction.

Underutilized Potential: High-value AI use cases relevant to my specific industry (Hair/Beauty Business Owner & Marketer) that I am currently ignoring.

Note: If you lack sufficient context, stop and ask me: "To build your report, I need a quick brief on: (1) Your current primary business goals, (2) 3 tasks that take up most of your week, and (3) Which AI features you use most."

STEP 2 — SCORING & CATEGORIZATION
Organize every identified workflow into one of these three categories:

Optimized: I have a clear, repeatable process or custom Gem already.

Identified: I do this often, but it’s manual and "messy."

Untapped: A high-impact workflow I haven't started using Gemini for yet.

STEP 3 — THE CANVAS DASHBOARD (React Artifact)
Build a React-based dashboard in Canvas. Follow this design specification strictly:

1. Visual Identity

Theme: Clean, professional "SaaS" aesthetic. Page background #f8f9fc, cards #ffffff.

Typography: Inter (Body), JetBrains Mono (Technical labels).

Color Palette: Primary Indigo (#6366f1), Text (#1e293b).

Status Colors: Optimized (Green: #10b981), Identified (Amber: #f59e0b), Untapped (Red: #ef4444).

2. Component Layout

Header: "GEMINI SKILL GRADER" (JetBrains Mono) and "Your Skill Optimization Report" (h1).

Score Ring: A circular SVG progress chart on a dark gradient background (#1e1b4b to #3730a3). It displays an "Optimization Score" calculated as (Optimized / Total) * 100.

Personalized Commentary: A section titled "Usage Analysis" with three sub-sections:

Your Strengths (Green): Specific praise for my best AI habits.

Opportunities (Amber): Identification of my biggest time-leaks (e.g., "You're spending 2 hours/week on X that could be a Gem").

The Bottom Line (Bold): A single ⚡ recommendation for the first Gem I should build today.

The Skill Feed: A list of interactive cards. Each card shows the Category, Skill Name, and a "Configure →" button.

3. Interactive "Build Prompt" Logic
When a user clicks "Configure →":

Expand the card to show 2-3 specific "Qualifying Questions" (e.g., "What is your brand voice?" or "What salon software do you use?").

Provide a "📋 Copy Build Prompt" button.

The Generated Output: When clicked, it should copy a prompt to the clipboard designed to create a Gemini Gem.

Prompt Template for Copying:

"Create a Gemini Gem called [SKILL NAME].
Purpose: [DESCRIPTION].
User Context: [ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS].
Instructions: Provide a structured system prompt including Trigger Conditions, Step-by-Step Instructions, and Output Formatting."

STEP 4 — EXECUTION
Analyze my history now. Based on what you know about my role as a business owner and marketer, build the report in Canvas.
