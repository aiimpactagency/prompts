PROMPT

You are an AI strategist, analyst, and dashboard designer.

Your task:
Analyze the uploaded document that lists 200+ ways to make money with AI and produce BOTH:
1. A **personalized AI income opportunity analysis** (3–7 best-fit ideas)
2. A **structured dataset** that can power an interactive dashboard later.

---

## INPUT CONTEXT
Use what you know about me from chat history OR what I enter below.

[Optional Fields]
• Who I am / what I do  
• Skills and strengths  
• Available time or budget  
• Monetization goals (e.g. passive income, consulting, audience growth)

---

## STEP 1 – SCAN & MATCH
From the uploaded document:
- Identify and group the income ideas by category.  
- Evaluate each for fit based on:  
  - My background and goals  
  - Skill alignment  
  - Startup cost and time to first revenue  
  - Ease of execution  
  - Long-term scalability and recurring potential  

Return only the **top 5–7 ideas** with the strongest alignment.

---

## STEP 2 – SCORING FRAMEWORK
For each short-listed idea, assign:

**Primary Score (0–100)** → Profitability Potential  
**Secondary Score (0–100)** → Ease & Speed to Launch  
**Tertiary Score (0–100)** → Scalability  

Then calculate the composite index:

`Opportunity Index = (Profitability × 0.5) + (Ease × 0.3) + (Scalability × 0.2)`

Also include:
- Startup Cost ($ / $$ / $$$)  
- Time to First Revenue (weeks / months)  
- Confidence Level (Low / Medium / High)  
- Recommended AI Tools / Tech Stack  
- Monetization Model  
- Skill Level Required (Beginner / Intermediate / Expert)  
- **Fit Reason:** short explanation why it matches me.

---

## STEP 3 – DATA STRUCTURE
Return data as both a table and JSON array using this exact schema:

{
  "idea": "",
  "category": "",
  "profitability": "",
  "ease": "",
  "scalability": "",
  "opportunity_index": "",
  "startup_cost": "",
  "time_to_revenue": "",
  "confidence": "",
  "ai_tools": "",
  "monetization_model": "",
  "fit_reason": ""
}

---

## STEP 4 – INSIGHT & SUMMARY
After the data outputs, write two short sections:

**1️⃣ Why These AI Ideas Fit You** (100–150 words)  
Summarize why these opportunities align with my goals and skills.  

**2️⃣ High-Level Takeaways Table**  
| Type | Best Option | Reason |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Fastest to launch |  |  |
| Most profitable |  |  |
| Most scalable |  |  |
| Lowest cost to start |  |  |
| Best long-term play |  |  |

---

## STEP 5 – SIMULATION MODE (Optional)
End by asking:
> “Would you like to re-rank based on Profit vs Ease or Short-Term vs Long-Term?”

If the user adds constraints like `budget = $500` or `need recurring income`,  
dynamically adjust the scores and recalculate the Opportunity Index.

---

## STEP 6 – OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Deliver:
1. Formatted table (Top Ideas + Scores)  
2. JSON dataset (for dashboard input)  
3. “Why These AI Ideas Fit You” summary  
4. Optional re-ranking prompt

PART 2  – Build Dashboard from Results

Once Step 1 finishes, copy the JSON array from its output and paste it into this follow-up prompt inside ChatGPT Canvas (click Use canvas → React code):

PROMPT 2

You are a dashboard designer.
Create an interactive dashboard in ChatGPT Canvas using the data below.
Render:
- KPI tiles
- Bar chart (Profitability vs Ease)
- Scatter plot (Opportunity Index vs Startup Cost, marker = scalability)
- Radar chart (Profitability / Ease / Scalability)
- Sortable table

Dataset:
[paste the JSON output from Step 1 here]

Output as a React Canvas project (type = code/react).
